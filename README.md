SuiFace is a cutting-edge decentralized face verification platform built on the Sui blockchain. It enables users to prove their humanity through advanced face detection technology and mint unique, soulbound NFT passports that serve as verifiable proof-of-humanity credentials.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Face Detection**: Advanced face verification using face-api.js
- **Soulbound NFT Passports**: Unique, non-transferable NFTs as proof of humanity
- **Decentralized Storage**: Images stored on Walrus decentralized storage network
- **One-Per-Wallet Policy**: Smart contract enforces single NFT per wallet address
- **Random UUID Generation**: Each passport gets a unique 6-character identifier
- **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive interface with celebration animations
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless connection with Sui wallets
- **Smart Contract Security**: Built with Move language for secure fund management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.18.0 or higher
- pnpm package manager
- Sui CLI tools
- A Sui wallet (Sui Wallet, Ethos, etc.)

## üì± How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users connect their Sui wallet to the application
2. **Face Verification**: Advanced AI analyzes the user's face through their camera
3. **Verification Success**: Once a human face is detected and verified
4. **NFT Minting**: Users can mint their unique Sui Face Passport NFT
5. **Proof of Humanity**: The soulbound NFT serves as verifiable proof of humanity

## üîê Smart Contract Features

- **One NFT Per Wallet**: Registry system prevents multiple NFTs per address
- **Soulbound Tokens**: NFTs are non-transferable (except for burning)
- **Random UUID**: Each passport gets a unique 6-character alphanumeric ID
- **Burn & Re-mint**: Users can burn their NFT and mint a new one if needed
- **Event Emission**: Smart contract emits events for frontend integration
- **Upgrade Capability**: Built-in upgrade mechanism for future improvements

## üé® NFT Metadata

Each Sui Face Passport NFT contains:
- **Name**: "Sui Face Passport #[UUID]"
- **Description**: "A Proof-Of-Humanity Passport SoulboundNFT"
- **Image**: Stored on Walrus decentralized storage
- **UUID**: Unique 6-character identifier
- **Owner**: Wallet address of the holder
- **Creator**: Contract deployer address
- **Created At**: Timestamp of minting
